      <p style="color:white;">
        <br> I am a web developer and I also served for the military.
          <br> My military experience taught me the importance of training and discipline.
          <br> I can work in teams with a hierarchy in place, or I enjoy individual projects.
          <br> I am passionate about my work reguardless.
          <br> I am a self-starter, and incredible at learning on my own.

      Currently looking for a remote tech career. After graduating high-school, I joined the Army among one of the first females to go 
    <br> through a combat arms osut. More specifically a tanker. I loved basic training, I made life long memories and friends, 
    <br> I thank god everyday for. I was stationed in the great state of Texas for 2 years and was awarded the Army achievement medal.
    <br> But along the way life had other plans for me. So I did what was best and moved back home to support my family and start school. 
    <br> I used the GI Bill for veterans and attended an online college. In college I was doing research and found DevCodeCamp. 
    <br> They accepted the GI Bill and have taught me a lot about software developing. I hope to find a job writing code 
    <br> and work with people who enjoy this field as much as I do.
