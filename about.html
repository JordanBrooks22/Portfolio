      <br>Currently looking for a remote tech career. After graduating high-school with a general degree, I joined the Army at 18. 
    <br> I was among some of the first females to go through a combat arms MOS. More specifically a tanker. 
    <br> I loved basic training, I made life long memories and friends. I learned a lot about who I was and what type of career I wanted in life. 
    <br> I was stationed in the great state of Texas for 2 years, there I was awarded the Army achievement medal after an NTC rotation in Califonia. 
    <br> I reached specialist was up to deploy but life had other plans for me. So I did what was smart and moved back home to indiana 
    <br> to raise my family and start school. I joined IvyTech in Warsaw Indiana. I enjoyed school and will continue to learn. On my third semester
    <br> I was looking for classes that more specifically could help Jordan's Revolutionary Code a bussiness I started to help improve and help my community.
    <br> In college I was doing research and found DevCodeCamp. An online accredited coding bootcamp. I hope to find a job with code and continue working 
    <br> with people who enjoy this field as much as I do so I can learn as much as possible.
